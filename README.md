Before anything, download:
- globals.ahk

this is also where you can change the resolution to match your game's
also change the waiting times if your PC is Faster/Slower
you can change the hotkeys for pausing or quitting the scripts too

For anything that involves doing quests, download:
- questing.ahk

It has most of the image detections like when a quest starts, ends, is repeat on/off,...
you also need to download the corresponding images in either 720p (Standard) or 1080p (Ultra)

### Quests
Download:
- AutoFarm.ahk

You need to change the CharacterIcon.png to your main character's icon on the top left of the screen inside any quest

Just press the "Home" key once you're in the quest you want to farm
Might need to change the "block" key since I'm on French keyboard
A->Q

### Slimepede
Download:
- SliminMulti.ahk
- Spin.ahk

#### In-Game Settings

most important thing is:
- Camera Repositioning OFF
- Battle Camera Repositioning OFF

SliminMulti.ahk has 5 different positionning:
- F5 for solo to be somewhat close to the back where the rainbow slime spawns
- F1 for back right corner (for player 1)
- F2 for back left corner (for player 2)
- F3 for front left corner (for player 3)
- F4 for front right corner (for player 4)

Spin.ahk is something that is started automatically as long as it's in the same folder as SliminMulti.ahk and is used to spin the camera left and right
As mentionned above you might need to change a few keys since I'm on french keyboard
like Z->W for forward or Q->A for left
